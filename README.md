This is to create maintain the Dockerfile for carla(on AMD graphics) and tensorflow(on NVIDIA card)

## How to build?

1. build docker with dockerfile for carla and tesorflow[probably make build script for that]
2. run the run.sh for each docker to run separately in thier own terminal.


Any sugestions are welcome, I'll try to keep it up to date as possible.


### Host environment:
1. POP os 20.04
2. Radeonâ„¢ RX 5700 XT Graphics | AMD --> used for Carla simulation
3. 	GeForce GTX 1660 Ti --> used for tensorflow docker
